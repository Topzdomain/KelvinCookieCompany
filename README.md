# KelvinCookieCompany
This is my first practice with git hub using the kelvin cookie dataset and following the youtube video from Kelvin Stratvert.
This project is to help me familiarize myself with the git and git hub envirionment. I also plan to go beyond where Kelvin stopped his video by adding an excel sheet to this project.
I started the project on Git Bash, then pushed the files and codes to git hub repositories.
